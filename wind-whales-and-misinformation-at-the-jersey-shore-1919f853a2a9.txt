A few months ago, an old friend of mine posted an Instagram story that appeared to show him at some sort of “save the whales” rally. Pleasantly surprised to see this person engaged in environmental activism, I sent him an encouraging message. His reply informed me that the event he attended was actually a protest against offshore wind power development in our home state of New Jersey.

My heart sank.

Since then, I’ve lost sleep over this issue. As if the tragedy of dying whales washing ashore wasn’t bad enough, the issue is generating misinformation that threatens to destroy vital renewable energy projects.

Spoiler: There’s no evidence that offshore wind projects on the East Coast, or anywhere else, have caused any whale deaths.

Yet, there’s a powerful movement to cancel offshore wind development and whales are at the center of the conversation. Let’s sort out the distressing facts from the distressing fictions.

Along the US Atlantic Coast, there’s an ongoing “unusual mortality event” concerning whale strandings. Stranding, or beaching, refers to a live whale or dolphin that comes ashore. Strandings are usually fatal.

The Marine Mammal Protection act defines an unusual mortality event (UME) as “a stranding that is unexpected; involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population; and demands immediate response.”

The following three species are affected:

It’s important to note that these three UMEs have been ongoing since 2016 and 2017. While this year has been particularly bad, especially in New Jersey, whale strandings are not a new problem for 2023.

Here’s a look at the past seven years of strandings for the species most affected, humpbacks and minkes.
